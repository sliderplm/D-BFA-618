# D-BFA-618Parcels
In this study, we developed a dynamic functional connectivity based parcellation framework, and established a new functional atlas of the human brain termed as D-BFA, consisting of 518 cortical, 62 subcortical and 34 cerebellar functional subregions.Furthermore, we also added the brainstem and ventral diencephalon into the D-BFA. As the first whole-brain atlas based on dFC, the proposed D-BFA delineates the finer functional boundaries that cannot be captured by static functional connectivity, and is further supported by good correspondence with cytoarchitectonic areas as well as task activation maps. Moreover, the D-BFA reveals the spatial distribution of dynamic variability across the brain, and generates the more homogenous parcels compared with most alternative parcellations. The D-BFA demonstrates the superiority and practicability of dynamic functional connectivity in brain parcellation, providing a new template to exploit brain topographic organization from spatial domain to spatial-temporal domain.
